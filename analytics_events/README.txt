The Google Analytics Events module is a very simple approach to bind DOM events with Google Analytics
events using jQuery selectors to match the HTML objects you want. It is a purely JavaScript
implementation

Install
-------
Google Analytics Events requires some external way to initialize GA user account. This could
be simply done using a module like http://drupal.org/project/google_analytics or equivalent.

Then instal Google Analytics Events like you would any other module.

1) Copy the analytics_events folder to the modules folder in your installation.

2) Enable the module using Administer -> Modules (/admin/build/modules).

3) No additional configuration is necessary though you may fine-tune settings at
   Administer -> Site configuration -> Google Analytics Events (/admin/settings/analytics_events).
